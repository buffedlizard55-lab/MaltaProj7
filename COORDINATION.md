# Historical coordination — session arena/e79e0de2-maltaproj7 (2026-10-18)

**Session ID:** arena/e79e0de2-maltaproj7 (platform-fixed branch; the brief's `session-<id>/<task>` naming cannot be used because Arena pins this session to its branch — same documented deviation as every prior session in this ledger).

**Pre-claim inspection (2026-10-18T09:41Z):** `origin/main` at `23f584e` (merge of PR #24). `gh pr list --state all` → PRs #1–#24 all **MERGED**; no open PRs. `git branch -a` → only `main` and this session's `arena/e79e0de2-maltaproj7` (no other remote branches, no other live session). Every board below is historical (all tasks done/merged), so no peer claim is outstanding and this session takes the remaining brief-driven work plus the final integration role the brief assigns to the last session.

**Local baseline:** `python3 build.py && python3 verify.py` → `Built 140 published events: 95 recurring, 45 special, 8 categories; 16 review records.` / `ALL LOCAL CATALOG, SOURCE-LINK, AND NAVIGATION CHECKS PASSED` (published=140 recurring=95 special=45 review=16 flags=29 categories=8).
